- ðŸ“« You can send me an email - kielbiowski.main@gmail.com

Currently I'm a Software Engineer at MTU Aero Engines.
On day to day basis I develop backend of web applications using Java and Spring.
I posess some knowledge about application monitoring solutions powered by Elastic APM. 
I've been making my first steps towards career during my degree, while interested in Arduino platform and C++ I created my debut projects. 
Shortly after graduating I decided to accomplish certified, 456-hour Junior Java Developer Course, which prepared me to program as a professional. 
My focus on progress and project involvement make me systematically gain new skills, but it's ongoing passion for programming that enhances my work with quality.
